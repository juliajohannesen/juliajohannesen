I'm a Software Engineer with a wide array of experience, from fullstack web
development to low-level embedded software. I like taking on challenging
problems, like distributed systems and type theory.

Most of the code I write these days is either in Go or Rust, with Rust being my
preference of the twoâ€” but I'm also experienced with C, Shell, Lua, Python, and
TypeScript, and can generally get to a proficient level in a new language after
just a few days.
